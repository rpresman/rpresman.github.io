I am a third year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistical Science at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu), working with [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io). Broadly speaking, I create methods for conducting Bayesian inference where constraints impose structure on unknown parameters, and develop efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms samplers for such problems.

Prior to Duke, I completed my MS in the Department of Statistics at [The University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu), where I was advised by [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). I spent a few years before graduate school consulting in the financial services sector.
