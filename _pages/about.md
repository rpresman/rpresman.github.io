I am a third year PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University, working with [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io). My current research focuses on developing methodology that is closely connected to ideas from the majorization-minimization literature.

Prior to Duke, I completed my MS in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu) at The University of Chicago, where I was advised by [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). I spent a few years before graduate school consulting in the financial services sector at [Quantitative Risk Management](https://www.qrm.com).
